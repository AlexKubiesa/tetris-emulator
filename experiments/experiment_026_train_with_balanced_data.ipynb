The spawn recall, precision and validity increase faster than with the unbalanced dataset, don't have such huge down-spikes, and don't get \"stuck\" at or near zero. The spawn recall is quite unstable up to about epoch 50 (jumping between near-zero and near-one), but it stabilises after that.\n",

I expect the same is true of spawn diversity too, even though the numbers here are inconclusive because again we got an unlucky run in terms of spawn diversity. Higher spawn diversity on the balanced dataset should yield the same on the unbalanced dataset because spawn diversity is only evaluated on block spawns, and there is nothing inherently different between the block spawns in one dataset as opposed to the other."

    "As predicted, the model does worse in a real game scenario. On block fall frames, the block usually falls correctly, but the model usually makes mistakes as the block lands. Extra cells get filled below the block, making it land earlier. Some cells randomly appear near the bottom of the board. Also, all block spawns are of type O, even though the model appears to have nontrivial (i.e. greater than 1/7 = 14.29%) spawn diversity. This suggests that the model has overfit block spawn type to the training data and cannot randomise block spawns based when taking its own output as input.\n",
    "\n",
    "This raises another interesting point. Perhaps the reason for all the botched block landings by this model is the method of recording test data. When we capture and save recordings, every frame has a defined position within the recording. For example, the frame when the first block spawns is always the second frame of a recording, never the first. Since most of the block shapes have a height of 2 and the recording length is 2 (1 input frame, 1 output frame), this may bias the dataset towards odd y-values in the grid behaving differently from even y-values. In a later experiment, we could record a dataset with potentially overlapping recordings to try remove any such bias, and see if this makes the model easier to train."

    "# Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Training on a dataset that is balanced between block falls and block spawns improves performance - and stability of performance - on the block spawns. However, the board accuracy on the unbalanced dataset is lower than for a model that was trained on the unbalanced data, and this manifests itself as poorer in-game performance on block falls, particularly as the block is landing.\n",
    "\n",
    "We noted that the poor block landing performance in the model trained on the balanced dataset may be due to a different type of bias in the recording process - that of preferring odd block y-coordinates in the first (input) frame and even y-coordinates in the second (output) frame. We can fix such bias, if it exists, by allowing recordings to overlap.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model trained on the balanced dataset still displays instability in spawn diversity, and even with nontrivial spawn diversity, may not produce diverse block spawns when used as an emulator since it repeatedly consumes its own output. More engineering is needed to achieve true spawn diversity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that balancing the dataset does improve and stabilise the block-spawn-related metrics, it makes sense to use more block spawn examples in training than in the original, unbalanced dataset, where the split between falls and spawns was about 95/5. A 50/50 split degrades production in performance, so we should choose a split that is somewhere between 95/5 and 50/50. Perhaps 80/20 would work."

    "Having run a number of training sessions, I found the following:\n",
    "* MSE loss is better than BCE for the autoencoder. BCE loss becomes very unstable when the loss gets too low and shoots back up, close to the original value. The normal advice is to use a `LogSigmoid` layer and `BCEFromLogitsLoss`, but we won't be able to do that when the encoder is part of a the full GameGAN generator.\n",
    "* A shallower convolutional network with kernel size 3 is better than a deeper one with kernel size 2. The latter took many more epochs to learn, and still did not quite reach the same board accuracy.\n",
    "* Increasing the channels in the hidden convolutional layers from 32 to 64 helped a lot.\n",
    "* Keeping batch norm in is better than removing it. Without batch norm, the model learns a lot more slowly.\n",
    "* Changing the \"leak\" (Leaky ReLU negative slope) from 0.2 to 0.1 makes the model learn more slowly.\n",
    "* Reducing the stride in the x-direction to make the intermediate boards more square and increase the number of spatial features at the `Flatten` layer increases the number of model parameters from 380K to over 1M, but doesn't improve performance, even after trying out variations of this.\n",
    "* Learning rate 1e-5 has no significant advantage over 1e-4. With 1e-5, the loss and accuracy curves are smoother, but the final values attained are not quite as good.\n",
    "* Changing the batch size from 4 to 12 sped up the training (with in-memory data) from 50 mins to 20 mins, improved training board accuracy, and test board accuracy stayed comparable.\n",

    "The final board accuracy of the last model was 99.85% on the training set and 81.00% on the test set."
